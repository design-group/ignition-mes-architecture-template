# Ignition Docker Project Template

___

## Prerequisite

Understand the process of creating docker containers using the [docker-image](https://github.com/design-group/ignition-docker).

This project assumes you have a local Traefik reverse proxy running, if not, you can set one up using this repository [traefik-proxy](https://github.com/design-group/traefik-proxy)

___

## Setup

1. Follow [this guide from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to create a new repository from the template.
2. Create a new directory for your project and clone the repository into it.

    ```sh
    mkdir <project-name>
    cd <project-name>
    git clone https://github.com/design-group/ignition-docker-project-template.git .
    ```

3. Rename the vscode workspace file to match your project name.

    ```sh
    mv ignition-project-template.code-workspace <project-name>.code-workspace
    ```

4. Review the `docker-compose.yml` file to verify the container structure is correct
5. If using a reverse proxy, go through the `docker-compose.traefik.yml` file and change all instances of `ignition-mes` to your project name.
6. Review the `.gitignore` file to add any
   additional directories and contents to ignore.
7. To name the compose project that will be built, edit the `.env` file and set the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` variable to the name of 	your project.

	```sh
	COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<project-name>
	```

	or if you are using trafik as a reverse proxy, set the `.env` file to:

	```sh
	COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR=:
	COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.traefik.yml
	COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<project-name>
	```

8. If mounting the `workdir` volume on a non-MacOS device, make sure to create the directory first so that it is owned by the user running the container.

	```sh
	mkdir ignition-data
	```

9. Pull any changes to the docker image and start the container.
      
    On Mac:
    
	```sh
    docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
    ```
    
	On WSL
    
	```sh
    docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
    ```

10. In a web browser, access the gateway at `http://localhost/` (No port is required, since the template is using port 80)

11. If using trafik as a proxy, access the gateway at `http://<project-name>.localtest.me`

___

## Gateway Config

The gateway configuration is stored in stripped gateway backups, that have all projects removed. In order to get these backups run the following command:

```sh
bash download-gateway-backups.sh
```

The backups are stored in the `backups` directory, and if configured in the compose file will automatically restore when the container is initially created. 

If you are preparing this repository for another user, after configuration of the gateway is complete, run the above backup command, and then uncomment the volume and command listed in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
